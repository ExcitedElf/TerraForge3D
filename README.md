# Note

* When you are stating up the app for first time it will need to download some things and cache them you can see the console for deails
* You can Show/Hide the console from Menu > Options > Toggle System Console.
* Whenever you feel that something is wrong or the app is slow check the console for updates

# Contributing

Since this project has become very large I would really love some help.
For a guide on how to get started developing TerraForge3D https://terraforge3d.gitbook.io/docs/developers-guide
Here are some things that you might contribute:

* A Documentation (written or video guide)
* Add comments to the source code
* Add the small values here and there to serialization which I may have missed
* Report any bug you can find.
* Add a new node
* You can post the screenshots of your creations to https://github.com/Jaysmito101/TerraGen3D/issues/10

# What of SHOWCASE?

After every 10 - 15 posts in https://github.com/Jaysmito101/TerraGen3D/issues/10 I would make a montage of all of them to show the capabilities of TerraGen3D!

# Support


Any support would be highly appretiated!

For example you could add a feature and contribute via pull requests or you could even report any issues with the program!

And the best thing you could do to support this project is spread word about this so that more people who might be interested in this may use this!

Please considering tweeting about this!
